## Welcome to the SwitchedBit Blog

Welcome back to the SwitchedBit blog! We're doing things a bit differently this time and using Github Pages to host all our content. Frankly I was just having way to many issues with Wordpress and maintaining it, then things got even weirder when I went to paying a firm for shared hosting.
So, GitHub pages it is! Let's see how this goes!

### What's the story here?
Well I work in PHP Development full time so I tend to ramble quite a bit about things I've learned here. In my spare time I also work with technology in general, and game quite a bit. So really if you're into technology, development and gaming, this might be the best blog for ya!
