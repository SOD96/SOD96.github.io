# Intro

This is an archived post from back in the day, I found that people were still coming here for a fix, so I fished the article from the dead. The below fix for the Out of Memory Error (2) should fix this...


Sadly after the years this game has been released on PC, this issue still isn't fixed. But I have a fix for you!



<a href="/assets/files/players2.zip" download>Players2.zip</a>



<ul><li>Extract the above players2 zip to your Call of Duty Modern Warfare remastered install directory, in my case this would be F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered</li><li>Launch the game</li></ul>



Issue here seems to be that this game will not create the configuration files in the install directory, why? Lord knows, but it throws this error because it assumes there isn't enough space to write to the disk. Which of course is incorrect.


Shoddy incorrect error messages and bugs that have existed since years ago, shame on Infinity Ward.

If the above file does not work, contact me, contact@seanodonnell.co.uk, it's sourced from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/393100/discussions/0/154641879455204696/#c154641879455578896) I've lost the files I used to fix this ages ago, but if it doesn't work let me know and I'll download and re-generate them for you.
