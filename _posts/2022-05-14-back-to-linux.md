# Initial Experience

Going to apologise off the bat, as there's quite a lot of context that led to this decision being made, but it's important if your a tinkerer and like to mess around quite a lot on your machine, I feel like you'd understand the process I went through!

I've been a bit of an OS Swapper for years now. Always giving Linux a go to see if I could squeeze extra performance and just... be different I guess. It never really worked, gaming always brought me back along with the eco system of Windows just making things easier. But I have to say, perhaps things have changed? Linux for the most part is now completely endorsed by Steam, one of the biggest gaming marketplaces. The fine detail is that Steam needs working machines in order to sell games and make money, they're hardly going to endorse Linux as an operating system if it doesn't play games, hence their users can't buy new games. Now that it has their backing, it felt worth it going back in.

Recently, earlier in the year, I made a massive effort to switch to Linux full time over a period of 6 months. Specifically, this was with Unraid, an excellent VM manager that would let you spin up virtual machines and actually have the hardware passed through to it with near 0 delay. Of course there's a lot of underlying technology within that, might talk about that later! You wouldn't notice that the hardware was being passed through, it ran just like a normal machine. To me, this was amazing. I could have one machine, with my Plex server and all my other dev things going on, while having a VM dedicated to Windows Gaming, and a VM dedicated to Linux for development. It was king.

But then, something happened. Tarkov started kicking users out of the game if they dared to have their game running in a VM. This was done to defeat cheaters. Of course cheaters still plague the game. This meant, me a completely legit player, couldn't play Tarkov a game I'd spent hundreds on. I was kinda pissed, so I went to get a refund. That didn't work. Same with Halo Infinite, Battlefield 2042, all the games that were coming out, were locked to Windows and I wanted to get on and play them.

So I was stuck. I could go back to Windows, but then I'd need to give up my entire Unraid setup and everything else. I started thinking about it and eventually it just made sense. Unraid was a fantastic solution but at the end of the day I was giving up performance just to be different.

## The transistion back to Windows

Ashamed of myself, I booted back up Windows and went to work reinstalling absolutely everything. The fun part about Windows and Linux using completely different file systems means you're totally screwed when it comes to data. Thankfully as I'll get into later, Windows did keep all my old files and such from OneDrive, so really I wasn't missing much. Heck, I didn't even notice I was missing anything when I was on Linux either. But I guess that's easy to do when you have two VMs and can access your data whenever you wanted. But I decided, a clean slate, start fresh, don't give a damn what's on the drives. All my development stuff is stored in git anyway, and anything else likely just me hording things.

I will say... getting my plex library back again was a chore. I do not wish that on anyone and I very much doubt I'll be switching away from the iMac anytime soon, especially with how useful Direct Play is. 0 Transcoding required!

But I was back. I could now play Halo Infinite, Battlefield 2042, Tarkov. And I did, I jumped right on those games just to be completely disappointed. 

I've spoke about [Battlefield 2042](https://switchedbit.com/posts/battlefield/) previously on this blog 

## What do I do?

At this point I need to wait for CDPR to fix the bug, which has existed apparently since launch and still isn't fixed. There's plenty of other people out there with the same issue as me. There isn't even any mods or hacks I can do to fix it either it seems. If anyone out there knows a fix, let me know! contact@seanodonnell.co.uk

## What I tried

Here's what I tried so you don't need to waste your time...

- Fired all sorts of commands into the Cyberpunk engine tweek thing
- Bought a new car and drove it to all the Del sites
- Tried to find a quest where it would force a new phone call. (Didn't find any quests)


One thing to note, for me this bug did go away, when a call was forced that did override Del. But it came back on the Placide mission I presume because it was still always bugged in the background. What do I know I've no idea how spaghetti wrecked this codebase is.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, I have to say my second playthrough has been much worse than my first. It feels like things have gotten worse both in terms of bugs and performance. All I can do is wait and see if they fix my issue, hence I have to implore you. Do not waste your time getting into this game, I regret it fully.
