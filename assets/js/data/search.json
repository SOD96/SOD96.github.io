I’ve been slowly migrating over game after game to Linux, and one big one I was into just before I switched was Battlefield 4. I’ve been enjoying replaying it, but I always ran into a few issues with the Linux version Origin was hell, Lutris never worked either with it Colour Grading was way off, it was like I was playing it on a 4 bit display FPS performance tanked Mouse Movements lagged behind, it would be around a 2 second delay My entire desktop would freeze for a good 3 minutes while it shut downIn other words, it was completely unplayable, however the good people on the Manjaro forums, Steam and everywhere else seem to be having no issues at all. Surely it must be me! But I’ve played nearly 60 hours of SWTOR the past 2 weeks, and countless hours of nearly every Call of Duty / Cyber punk game, never ran into any issues like this on those… was it me?It did dawn on me however, that my experience with Call of Duty, wasn’t the best. It did chop around and the mouse movements were so bad it would put you in hospital with stress. Perhaps it was an issue with me, so I set out to find out!An entirely new Desktop Environment???Yes, the first thread I came across recommended a new desktop environment or playing around in that sector. Straight up, do not do this. I’ve now got a situation where I have two, split across different users and my original doesn’t work like it used to. It’s fine, but whatever commands I ran, just don’t do it. Don’t go down this hole because your problem is unlikely to be with the DE, at least consider your own hardware. I’m running a Ryzen 9 3900x and a RTX 2080ti. I should be able to handle any DE that comes my way. I’m now left trying to restore my life back to how it used to be!Perhaps it was Lutris!A Worthy suggestion, I’m not too clever with how Lutris works, but I imagine the brainboxes at valve with their far simplier UI must have figured it out a tad better, after all, whenever I launched Battlefield 4, all it did was launch Origin! Surely Steam would have a better solution… It does and it doesn’t. It doesn’t launch Origin (At least not fat origin), but it came with all the same problems that Lutris had. I spent £3.99 on EA Access just to test this, problem existed on both platforms. Game would be choppy, mouse lagging, etc…WHY XORG!Throughout all of this one common enemy was XORG being at 100% CPU usage whenever Battlefield launched. This same thing occured whenever I moved the Spotify window, which also was powered off this, however firefox was fine, I presume because that goes via Wayland? I’m still getting used to all the terminology, but this is when things started to click and the research got deeper. I came across an archived article https://archived.forum.manjaro.org/t/high-cpu-usage-caused-by-xorg/139238 which is exactly why I am making this post, to forever preserve this information, at least in a git repo somewhere (This blog is hosted on Github Pages), doubt it’ll be closing anytime soon.My issue, was with xorg, and more importantly an application that was using Xorg to render the view. As Fabby said Yup. That’s an application bug that crashes the compositor and has Xorg CPU usage rung through the roof! Which application? That’s the hard one to figure out: I’ve had it with VLC and qBittorrent in the past, but they’re OK now, so see which applications you’re running and if you find the offending one, file a bug report.Straight away I started closing things off in the task bar one by one, then I seen Xorg go from 100% CPU to not even on the list. Fired up Battlefield 4, and the issue was completely gone.Normal UsersNow, throughout all of this I’ve had to do some pretty damn technical stuff. Everytime I come into one of these challenges I always leave happier because now I know in the future if XOrg is kicking up a stink, it’ll be because some application is having a good old time somewhere ruining my day. But one thing I can’t escape from, is how on gods earth would a user know how to troubleshoot any of this. There’s a good chance I wouldn’t have found that article, and still not have fixed it. I was inches away from reinstalling Manjaro. Which would have fixed it, until I reinstalled Jetbrains Toolbox. But that’s exactly what happens. We get an issue like this, rather than fixing it, we just reinstall and call it a day without knowing exactly what happened and what might help someone else in the future.So, lucky internet user, if this sorts you out, let me know!ConclusionSomething like this, I feel should warn the user. It doesn’t seem normal that a key system process like this should be able to exhaust resources to the point where the system becomes unresponsive. A simple check on how resources are being used to warn the user perhaps of the offending process would be suitable. Let them terminate the app, or keep it running.Either way, it’s a really complex issue it seems for it all just to be related to “Aw you’ve got a dodgy application open that’s not got that great support”Great, guess we’re all just waiting on Wayland right :)" }, { "title": "Revisiting StreamUpdater.com | Revisiting old side projects", "url": "/posts/streamupdater-revisit/", "categories": "development", "tags": "PHP, Laravel, php8, laravel8, laravel9, StreamUpdater.com, Twitch, Twitch API, Twitch PHP API, Twitch Web Sockets, Old Side Projects, PHP Side Project, Web Development", "date": "2022-06-19 14:24:00 +0100", "snippet": "The Old FlameIt’s been a good while since I opened up some of my old Web Development projects. Namely StreamUpdater. It was my first real go at something rather challenging. A C# app and a PHP Laravel API to handle all the data sending from that C# App. It was extremely fun. The jist of it is, if you’re playing a game and live streaming, the last thing you want to do is bother with changing your title and what game you are playing. I developed an app in C# that would get your list of processes running on your machine, send that to StreamUpdater.com whereby I’d then do my magic and update your Twitch Account. It worked really well!However, this week it ran into some issues…Users? Here? Localised entirely within this applications database?The interesting thing about StreamUpdater is that I typically get a new organic signup every month, but I’ve never understood why they never really did much. Until one of those faithful signups joined the discord and complained about 500 errors.It turns out, that since the switch from Laravel 5 to Laravel 9 there was a change to how logs were handled, so any error messages weren’t getting saved. Also in my adventures changing web hosts every month it meant my .env files never got saved so plenty of details were missing. I just assumed this was fine with the new sign ups and because my account was still working. (I actively used the product) so it seemed fine to me! Just goes to show, I really wasn’t testing and that’s totally on me. Lessons learned.But I had users! Turns out there were a few issues… They weren’t getting the welcome email They weren’t getting any of the correct starter data configured for things like user settings Logs weren’t saving, so I wasn’t aware of any issues going onSo they weren’t getting notified where to go for support, so that was strike one. Second was that due to that welcome email not going out, the app crashed and never setup various other settings that are requrired I have of course fixed this but yeah, not good! This mean that whenever they went to the app, they got a 500 error, since my logging wasn’t working I wasn’t ever notified.Fixes for the issuesAnnoyingly, I never had an environment setup to easily get StreamUpdater up and running locally. I typically used a minified and obfuscated version of the live production database but it’s been a while and looking at those relationships made me want to die. So yes, I developed in production. While not suitable, considering the only people live on the application was me and this dude that decided to let me know “Hey dude, your building is on fire did you know that”, I decided it was a worthy risk and my new friend would help me along! Which he did! Thank you Benjas333The fixes, annoyingly, were very easy…Emails didn’t send because my .env never had my G-Suite details saved, hence it wouldn’t send emails from the info@streamupdater.com accountThings were 500 erroring all over the place because new accounts weren’t getting their settings and configuration files saved, this was due to the previous error. I setup new accounts AFTER the welcome email sent, that now occurs before. This honestly happened because as I added new features I just added the setup step to the end of the new account login function.Old CodeOne thing that this experience brought was learning from my old code. So many mistakes, so many un-optimized functions and things I could have done better. To be honest reading through it I wanted to just nuke the codebase and restart on a brand new Laravel 9 application, with Vue and Inertia JS. It absolutely would have been a night and day improvement. When I built StreamUpdater I don’t even think I was working full time. I hadn’t had any commercial PHP experience. However, with that new experience comes the making do with what you have. Plenty of companies are still out there running PHP 5.6 on their production boxes because hey, it’s working and that’s all that matters. I use an extreme example, please don’t use out of date software (It’s why, while I might avoid new features with my projects, I always migrate them to the new version of Laravel every year)But I stuck with it, resolved everything in about 2 days. (I had a wedding in the middle of that, so reasonable excuse for the delay) Whereas if I just nuked it all, I’d have to restart completely from start, chances are I wouldn’t be writing this blog and I’d just shut the project down. StreamUpdater took a good few weeks to initially build, scrapping all that time invested is just extremely bad planning. I’ll keep it, and instead just refactor what I need to refactor. Frontend absolutely needs improved I’ll bring in some new updates for that. The good thing is it does offload a good lot of the processing to many of the controllers and such, so nothing much is done in the front-end. I at least got that right, so plugging a new frontend should actually be smooth. Blog post for that no doubt! But I’m also developing a cross-platform app in Rust so it’ll work on Linux, Mac and Windows! Before since it was C# it was Windows only.Since we’re chatting about old code, here’s a fantastic foreach loop that I did years ago…$bots = Bot::where(&#39;pid&#39;, &#39;!=&#39;, NULL)-&amp;gt;get();if($bots) { foreach(Bot::where(&#39;pid&#39;, &#39;!=&#39;, NULL)-&amp;gt;get() as $bot) { }}I know it hurts to look at! Trust me there is plenty more in here, but it brings us onto a new topic rather nicely!Why isn’t it open source?I love Open Source code. Infact I’ve started building all my new projects Open Source. The main reason why this and plenty of my other old side projects aren’t open source is an absolute fear of vulnerabilities. There’s plenty of things I haven’t done right. I know they haven’t been done right and I’d love to accept pull requests for peoples suggestions on how they could be done better, but without a community around the app to do such a thing, it would be wildly irresponsible for me to open source a project, that I myself don’t have time to fix, that I’m still publically allowing people to use.At least if there is a vulnerability, it’s made a hell of a lot harder to find. And I know security via obsecurity is bad but security via throwing your source code out there and not fixing any issues is also bad! Btw, if anyone wants to maintain or help me on this project. I’m all about that hit me up on contact@seanodonnell.co.ukConclusionSo yes, StreamUpdater. I never fully killed it off, but I’ve got some new ideas and think I’ll give it another go to see if people want to use it. I think the hardest part has been that it’s always been in active development so it’s always been a bit of a uphill battle retaining users. But now I have a suitable product that I’ve actually tested I’ll work offline for a bit and get something worth releasing as a suitable v1.1. I’m rather happy with how it works at the moment for it to be considered a Version 1.It’ll update your stream title and game with whatever content you want to throw in there, and even log messages, has a chat bot and loyalty system. It integrates with Spotify and even allows you to do song requests via youtube. It’s jank and I’d like to improve it.

One thing that you can always bet on, is that as soon as I have annual leave or some kind of holiday, about 6 hours in I’ll get bored and want to do something programming related. In a bid to try avoid anything involving work this week, I bought a course on Udemy regarding C++. It’s something I’ve never hidden in that I do want to get into game development within some capcity. I feel like whenever I play games I have some great ideas, or run into bugs I’m sure I’d love to fix. Unfortunetly, being the self taught variety of programmer, it means I’ve never really understood the appropriate name for things. I was using OOP before I even knew what it was. I didn’t even know what OOP stood for before I was comercially deploying features and bug fixes.I’ve understood code, and read code, it’s how I’ve gotten to where I am, by hitting breakpoints and debugging what something does. I suppose it’s the reverse order of what most people do, but it’s why I think I’m pretty decent at bug fixing and working things out! It’s also why I think, once I understand the syntax any language is possible given enough determination, I suppose that’s the same for nearly everybody! You can master anything, given enough time. (Except any egg eating competitions, sadly I’m allergic)So where now?Now that I’ve been developing in PHP for some time. To be honest I love the language, and I can find so many uses for it. It’s rather easy to create projects and such when all you need to do is tell folk to go to an address. C++ on the other hand, hmm not so much. Say I wanted to create StreamUpdater but within C++. Really what would the purpose of that be? The Website is fantastic place where you can edit things all rather easily, in C++ I’d likely have to make a desktop app. Then you need to think about syncing settings aswell, sure I could have a Web API for that, but then if I’m creating Web Services I might aswell just keep it all on the web? Perhaps there’s a benefit to creating a Desktop App. I know there’s plenty that would prefer it, even just for the performance uplift, I’ve not been too bothered about things like that though, especially when you know your market. The people most likely to use something like a Stream Updater aren’t going to be on low power machines, if they are, then chances are they won’t be streaming for much longer if their quality isn’t the best. Who knows, plenty of people have broken through with their scufffed-ness.OfftrackAnyway, we’re getting offtrack. The main purpose of me wanting to learn C++ was one of just wanting to be able to read it in a more understanding way. Also, plenty of the concepts involved in C++ actually infiltrate many other languages. As I said before with OOP or Inheritance, variables, constants they all are present in something like a PHP. So I’ve no doubt really that picking up C++, would actually also broaden my understanding of how things work in PHP. Oddly enough I can’t actually think of any projects I’d like to do in C++ that doesn’t involve some part of Game Development. The issue with Game Development is my mind is always shooting for the stars.Stars shot and missedYou can always count on me to start a very ambitious project. For a start I was trying to create an MMORPG. (I know, everyone does this), very quickly I ran into some massive uphil battles. How on earth do I create a dedicated server How on earth can I trust what the client sends me Inventory management, what Database do I use for that?? Hacks, Cheats, bad people are at the forefront of decisionsJust on the subject of hackers and cheaters. It has to be at the forefront of your decision making, which plenty of AAA studios tend to neglect. I’m sure your all aware of when New World launched plenty of exploits were quickly found due to development decisions taken when the game was first being built. Something like that, you don’t want to get 1 year into a project and it turns out you need to do everything differently or account for it through hacks and sloppy-ness in the code. Ouch!I actually created a pretty decent loading screen, but it was based on my prior knowledge that I did it on…I had a loading screen, whereby you would pick a name, class, some customization options then create the character. What that would then do is send a POST request to a API that would then do all the validation and everything else. The data would then be stored in a database. Of course this was a laravel backend.But my question was. Is this correct? Surely not. Surely Blizzard isn’t doing a POST request to an accounts.blizzard.eu are they? Perhaps they are, but that’s why I want to get involved in learning, perhaps the concepts I know in PHP don’t apply to things like C++ or an architecture where you have a dedicated server. Surely there’s another protocol or call I can do server side to create these things. Things like UDP traffic for tracking what players are doing in the world, would a UDP packet create the account some how? I have no idea!If anyone has any suggestions for books that might answer these questions or talks let me know! I Always attend the Eurovision talks on Game Development, they’re always very insightful and interesting. However they do tend to lead a bit heavy on the marketing.ConclusionAnyway, as I was saying. Bored on my holidays so now I’ve ventured 6 chapters into a C++ course and I’m enjoying it very much! So far the start has been a lot of what I already know via PHP, but I’m picking up the terms and it seems very easy. I suppose my questions are… when do I stop making console C++ applications and how hard am I going to hit my head when creating a GUI?Still need to figure out an appropriate C++ project though. I’m doomed if I don’t have some way to channel the learning into something I actually want to make. But who needs C++ apps these days? Is there anywhere people have requests or something? I don’t mind making some open source software for folks that need it. I created a simple CRM (https://zodazn.com) for anyone not wanting to pay through the nose for the others out there.Any thoughts, hit my inbox contact@seanodonnell.co.uk" }, { "title": "How to Fix Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered Out of Memory Error", "url": "/posts/mw2-players-folder-fix/", "categories": "gaming", "tags": "bug, call-of-duty, out-of-memory, out-of-memory-error, modern-warfare, mw2, mw, cod, out-of-memory-bug, call of duty modern warfare remastered out of memory error 12, out of memory error 12, Call of Duty MW Out of Memory Error, Disk Space MW Error, modern warfare remastered out of memory error 12", "date": "2022-05-16 09:24:00 +0100", "snippet": "IntroThis is an archived post from back in the day, I found that people were still coming here for a fix, so I fished the article from the dead.

Always giving Linux a go to see if I could squeeze extra performance and just… be different I guess. It never really worked, gaming always brought me back along with the eco system of Windows just making things easier. But I have to say, perhaps things have changed? Linux for the most part is now completely endorsed by Steam, one of the biggest gaming marketplaces. The fine detail is that Steam needs working machines in order to sell games and make money, they’re hardly going to endorse Linux as an operating system if it doesn’t play games, hence their users can’t buy new games. Now that it has their backing, it felt worth it going back in.Recently, earlier in the year, I made a massive effort to switch to Linux full time over a period of 6 months. Specifically, this was with Unraid, an excellent VM manager that would let you spin up virtual machines and actually have the hardware passed through to it with near 0 delay. Of course there’s a lot of underlying technology within that, might talk about that later! You wouldn’t notice that the hardware was being passed through, it ran just like a normal machine. To me, this was amazing. I could have one machine, with my Plex server and all my other dev things going on, while having a VM dedicated to Windows Gaming, and a VM dedicated to Linux for development. It was king.But then, something happened. Tarkov started kicking users out of the game if they dared to have their game running in a VM. This was done to defeat cheaters. Of course cheaters still plague the game. This meant, me a completely legit player, couldn’t play Tarkov a game I’d spent hundreds on. I was kinda pissed, so I went to get a refund. That didn’t work. Same with Halo Infinite, Battlefield 2042, all the games that were coming out, were locked to Windows and I wanted to get on and play them.So I was stuck. I could go back to Windows, but then I’d need to give up my entire Unraid setup and everything else. I started thinking about it and eventually it just made sense. Unraid was a fantastic solution but at the end of the day I was giving up performance just to be different.The transistion back to WindowsAshamed of myself, I booted back up Windows and went to work reinstalling absolutely everything. The fun part about Windows and Linux using completely different file systems means you’re totally screwed when it comes to data. Thankfully as I’ll get into later, Windows did keep all my old files and such from OneDrive, so really I wasn’t missing much. Heck, I didn’t even notice I was missing anything when I was on Linux either. But I guess that’s easy to do when you have two VMs and can access your data whenever you wanted. But I decided, a clean slate, start fresh, don’t give a damn what’s on the drives. All my development stuff is stored in git anyway, and anything else likely just me hording things.I will say… getting my plex library back again was a chore. I do not wish that on anyone and I very much doubt I’ll be switching away from the iMac anytime soon, especially with how useful Direct Play is. 0 Transcoding required!But I was back. I could now play Halo Infinite, Battlefield 2042, Tarkov. And I did, I jumped right on those games just to be completely disappointed.I’ve spoke about Battlefield 2042 previously on this blog, switching my entire environment to play that game absolutely wasn’t worth it. Halo Infinite never kept my attention enough and Tarkov left such a sour taste in my mouth with how the support treated me, I didn’t want to play it again.So here I was. Stuck on Windows now, absolutely dejected that I’d spent all this time moving back to Windows when it absolutely wasn’t worth it. But hey, maybe the performance is better right?PerformanceThere’s a distinct vibe on the internet for me, everyone is getting better performance than me and for the life of me I can’t figure out why. That happened with Cyberpunk recently. I was getting drops down to 20FPS in certain areas, even on Low. Hearts of Iron takes an absolute eternity to load aswell. Also, if you use OneDrive and it is accessing the same files that your game is accessing, like, SAVE GAMES?? It’ll make your game go super slow and lock it up while it uplodas it. Very annoying.Also, when it came to something like Origin updating games. For some reason Windows Defender kept scanning every downloaded file. thus completely wrecking my SSDs and my performance. I have a Gigabit internet connection, so I’m downloading a 1Gig, onto a drive that’s both trying to write and read it as fast as possible. That’s not good for anybody. Also, YOU CAN’T DISABLE IT, AS THEY RE-ENABLE IT AFTER 24 HOURS.I’d had enough. That day I got a USB stick and put Manjaro on it.What then?Simply put I installed Manjaro to a partition on one of my M.2 Drives. Sure enough I haven’t been back to Windows since. It’s been 2 weeks now, I’ve got 4TB of SSD drives tied up in Windows Storage Spaces that I haven’t been able to use, but I don’t have any need for them. I can’t think of anything that’s on them that I actually care about. So I have a good mind to just go on there, and nuke them into some kind of ZFS pool. Heck maybe it’ll perform better. Storage Spaces was a pain in the butt to setup in the first place. Genuinely crashed the first 3 times I tried to do it. It’s a GUI! There isn’t much else I can do other than press next!PerformanceNow, what this whole article was really about, was gaming performance on Linux. I’m rather happy to report that those CyberPunk issues still affect me even on Linux, with one exception… I don’t care as much.On Windows it made no sense. I had DLSS, I had everything cranked to low, there wasn’t a REASON for it to be hitting 20fps. That seemed like a failure in the game to me. Switching to Linux has in my eyes proved that. I don’t have any of the fancy features that Windows has to preserve FPS. Yet it performance near identical. That’s enough for me to back that horse and hope it gets better. At least Linux has a reason for the bad performance. IE: It’s a game that isn’t native to it, hence has to use Wine (Proton)Also with Hearts of Iron, I challenge any of you, if you play Hearts of Iron, use the Windows version, and time how long it takes for the game to start up, then use the Native Linux Version. You’ll be blown away at how quick it is.DataThere’s also the topic of data. In my time I’ve been through the internet when we had dial up. To AOL, to storing passwords in the browser. All in all, I’ve seen it all and to be fair to myself it’s left some pretty nasty habbits that aren’t really needed anymore these days. Like the absolute want to preserve data.All my pictures, are always sent through my iPhone. My mum sends any family pictures over Facebook, those automagically get saved to iCloud and I pay £2.99 for that peace at mind. I could go out, flush my phone, get a new one and all my data would download back to it. Heck, if I switched to android, all I need to do is migrate all the data across, and that takes a few minutes.Secondly, passwords are stored now in the cloud, every AV tool has their own Password Manager. LastPass is a perfectly fine way of saving all your passwords, and even then it allows you to secure store files and notes. I don’t know how many times it’s saved my bacon when I’ve remembered I took an excerpt of a terminal print out with sensitive details and just lobbed it in there INCASE I needed it. Sure enough, always do! But that isn’t dependant on my operating system!I recall one thing that I always tried to keep was the NAND flash of my Uncles Xbox 360. We flashed it one day, and JTAG’d it so I needed to keep those files incase he ever wanted to go back to retail.Back to retail, in 2022. Why the hell do I still have those files. Throw them into LastPass, and don’t think about them again!Although on that Topic my OneDrive subscription has saved me numerous amounts of times when it comes to certain things and documents on my desktop. That’s something that I perhaps should look into for Linux. If anyone has any backup recommendations, let me know at contact@seanodonnell.co.ukConclusionSo here we are, at the end of the day, I’m typing this to you on Manjaro (archbtw) Linux am just about to boot up Cyberpunk so I can finish off this blasted story. Yes from my previous blog post I was done with it, but I went back 6 hours and just did everything again. I will finish this game! I’m saving a lot more too, just incase!I’ve regretted nothing so far, being adventerious and messing around so much with my own machine has led me down the path I am on today. There’s no better career advancement than doing something like this just for the hell of it. You’ll learn a bunch. I’d always ask any would be IT Technican to at least have one Linux system in their house so they aren’t out of the loop on everything. This week was my first time installing a new Kernel for different features. I didn’t even need to reboot my machine. How on earth is Windows still in the 90s.Development has also been far more simple. I’m not running a VM Anymore or WSL2 to develop on, which means there’s been less issues in the networking department. Whenever I was on a VPN, it would mean my WSL2 instance couldn’t connect to the internet. A known bug apparently. Don’t have that issue anymore on Linux.So yes, I’m rather happy where I am, but we’ll just need to wait and see. I do have an Xbox Series X these days so I dunno, might just attach a mouse and keyboard to it and go away playing games that way I guess!" }, { "title": "My Experience with Cyberpunk 2077", "url": "/posts/cyberpunk/", "categories": "gaming", "tags": "cyberpunk-2077, bugs, game-issues, video-games, cd-project-red", "date": "2022-05-06 14:24:00 +0100", "snippet": "Initial ThoughtsI actually bought Cyberpunk 2077 on day one, and blasted through it to my dismay when (spoilers) there was an effective “No Return” in the end mission. Meaning when you finish the mission, it’ll just reload your last save. I’ve always found this massively lazy because you don’t keep any of the loot or levels gained during that last mission. It’s all for nothing.Other than that. I actually had a really enjoyable experience with the game. But I bought it on the Epic Game Store. So I didn’t actually get any of the steam achievements something which I actually like to collect. So I figured while it was on sale, I’d buy it again and do another playthrough, this time with it being patched up and having tons of fixes. I couldn’t wait.Patches? What Patches?I cannot explain to you how worse this game experience is. Nearly every quest has had some sort of bug, the Delamain quest with the Taxis is completely bugged whereby Del is now present on the screen constantly in a call, meaning I can’t use my phone. MEANING any quest where you interact with your phone. IE: THE MAIN STORY QUEST, WHERE YOU TALK TO PLACIDE WITH THE VAN, DOESN’T WORKI can’t progress. I can’t do anything. I checked online and the only feedback I see is “Just load a save from before you did the Del quest where you smashed up the car”I’ve done perhaps 5-6 hours of side content in between that mission, I’ve progressed the main story since then. It’s actually sunk cost at this point to restart my entire save again.Not to mention performance just feels worse. I’ve got a Ryzen 9 3900x, and an RTX 2080ti. FPS is genuinely around 30-40 when in gunfights. It’s unacceptable.What do I do?At this point I need to wait for CDPR to fix the bug, which has existed apparently since launch and still isn’t fixed. There’s plenty of other people out there with the same issue as me. There isn’t even any mods or hacks I can do to fix it either it seems. If anyone out there knows a fix, let me know! contact@seanodonnell.co.ukWhat I triedHere’s what I tried so you don’t need to waste your time… Fired all sorts of commands into the Cyberpunk engine tweek thing Bought a new car and drove it to all the Del sites Tried to find a quest where it would force a new phone call. (Didn’t find any quests)One thing to note, for me this bug did go away, when a call was forced that did override Del. But it came back on the Placide mission I presume because it was still always bugged in the background. What do I know I’ve no idea how spaghetti wrecked this codebase is.ConclusionAt the end of the day, I have to say my second playthrough has been much worse than my first. It feels like things have gotten worse both in terms of bugs and performance. All I can do is wait and see if they fix my issue, hence I have to implore you. Do not waste your time getting into this game, I regret it fully." }, { "title": "Creating Streambit.TV", "url": "/posts/streambit/", "categories": "development", "tags": "aws, development, php, nginx, webserver, streaming, streambit, vod, video, wowza", "date": "2022-04-16 15:13:00 +0100", "snippet": "StreamBitI created Streambit as an answer to a lot of drama that happened a couple of years ago, PLUS I was heavily into streaming and wanted to learn how the process worked. What I learned was a tale of absolute hardship, uphill battles and looking at chinese encoders. If you want the skinny, please don’t develop your own platform.StreamingA bit of background. I streamed pretty much constantly on my old twitch channels (rip usernames), I now stream solely on Twitch.tv funny story about that, I created the channel SwitchedBit so I could use the username, realized that you can change usernames, now am waiting 6 months to get my better username.Anyway, I’m a streamer, I wanted to make my own platform because it seemed like a decent market. Twitch Streamers kept getting banned for things that I found rather funny (I’ve grown up since, before you flame me, I realize that banning them was the best course).LearningA lot of it was also built in my philosophy of build what you want to use. All my projects come from the angle that I think I could do something better, and that was slightly true for streaming. I feel like many of these platforms come from their old codebase and perhaps things aren’t as optimized, maybe I’ll think of a killer idea that would be great for streamers. Perhaps I’ll combine ReStream and Twitch and create a streaming network that endorses going out to multiple platforms rather than stifling competition. Either way I was sold on the idea. Plus it would be a great opportunity to learn.StackFor the stack I went with… Laravel (PHP) AWSSimple as that. It’s a full Laravel app using Blade Templating and integrates with various AWS services to perform the encoding to multiple different formats. Now during this process, Twitch was purchased by Amazon. Which meant that not only were Twitch a competitor of mine, AWS was now too, and if I built a streaming platform on their platform, they were winning either way. They either got my eyeballs from watching Twitch content, or they got my money from the insane charges. (Bandwidth costs and Video is extremely expensive just FYI)So, once I came to terms with that, I pressed on. AWS was the only real way I could do something like this at scale. I can’t exactly self host my own encoder platform and ingest thousands of gigs of video every second. AWS can. At a cost of course…You might’ve noticed I’ve not mentioned streaming yet, well… let’s get into that.How hard can streaming video really be?So. Streaming video. All in all this was a process I’m glad I did as I learned quite a lot. Where do you start with streaming video. It’s perhaps the most painful thing a developer can get involved in. Browser Standards for one, some browsers behave differently with different media players. Heck actually creating a media player, are you insane? If you want a challenge in your life try creating a media player with the different browsers. It’s great that edge is chromium now, but back when I was doing this they weren’t!As it became obvious to me, off the shelf video streaming plugins or composer packages didn’t really exist. I had to start from the ground up, and what that meant is I had to google and hope other devs had ran into the same issue. And oh boy they had.There was this forum post, absolutely lost now about this NGINX RTMP encoder, only issue was it was written in Chinese. But by god it actually worked. I could sent a stream to this and place it on web pages (some, remember browsers are a hassle).So we were good right! I had the backend! I’d just let my users throw their streams to a NGINX server then throw that content up on my website.SECURITYThe biggest hurdle during all of this then became security. Stream Keys are a thing! Maybe some O-Auth, what about getting OTP implemented. Implemented into what? The world used X-Split at the time or OBS. Sure OBS is open source so I could run over and code up my own implementation, but if I wanted this to work, I’d need to have StreamBit in that dropdown so people could easily authenticate. Never mind the hurdles I’d then have trying to engineer this RTMP NGINX Plugin to only work for certain stream keys and all the rest of it. Basically, the challenge was far to large to overcome, please if you think you’re better than me have a pop at it. But I gave up with that after weeks of banging my head against a wall and went with another solution… or well 5 other solutions, I tried ones such as Red5, Adobe Media Server but they never worked or has some extremely outdated documentation. Also keeping in mind that if I couldn’t get StreamBit into the dropdown, I’d have to go for the dreaded “Custom” option, which then added a new layer of having users that didn’t know what details to enter in. Less barriers of entry = more users.WowzaWowza came into my life and very quickly fixed a few glaring issues. I now had the streaming problem done by a third party, with a fantastic media engine, API and affordable plans. They even had an unlimited free dev trial so I could keep plodding away whenever I wanted. How did I find Wowza? I read online that it was the engine that Twitch first went with. I’m not sure if they still use them, or if they have their own now. But it gave me enough confidence to jump in, and with a lack of sleep, reading 1 vague post online, I setup Wowza.Now of course, with anything that I’ve described in this post, there’s always a but. When I first streamed with it, it worked, great. Fantastic. Except… why was there nearly a 2 minute delay in my stream. I’d do something and wouldn’t hear about it till the next day. Something was off. After digging through mountains of documentation and unanswered community posts on the issue, I settled with changing enough values and whatnot that over the course of messing around over 2 weeks, the lowest I could get the latency was around 10 seconds - 15 seconds. The community seemed to agree that 1 second was possible, but it would buffer like mental. And it did.So here I was, weeks thrown away for a streaming engine that wouldn’t perform anywhere near what my competitors had. Not to bash Wowza, it’s a tricky challenge and apparently it’s possible on their software. It’s been years also since I last used it, maybe it’s easier now! To be clear this isn’t me bashing Wowza. It’s me showing how hard and fiddly this problem is. Maybe I was a setting away from figuring it out. We’ll never know.So I gave up. Again.Back to VideoSo I went back to Video, at least I had that working, comments, everything else, I had a bog standard video sharing platform, I could sell this surely. Then the Pandemic hit. And I seen a pivot worthy moment where the boom of Work from Home and especially Teach from home took off. Surely I could get some interest if I pivoted my platform and made it a platform that perhaps kids could use? And that’s when we start getting off the deep end and start getting into societies issues, along with political ones.My aims this entire time was to create a platform that those cancelled voices could use. But I then wanted to shift into providing content that had to be locked down, perhaps a platform that someone could license from me and do what they want.It became too blurry, I lost sight of what I was trying to build and eventually ended up not seeing the point. Those people that got cancelled, got cancelled for a reason, their views were typically frowned upon by society and any company letting them speak was opening up the a majority not wanting to use them. As a business that is untenable.Wanting to serve content to teachers and kids and bridge that gap. Sure, here’s a very quick life lesson. If you’re a developer don’t get involved in safe guarding or any of that, it’s a nightmare to navigate and something that genuinely you don’t want to be responsible for. Leave it to the giants with lawyers and an army of business people.So, what about just a normal video platform? I decided to give up on this because of a moderation angle. Twitter has issues with deleting videos, I don’t know how many videos I’ve seen of the Ukrainian war of dead bodies across the street and decapitated children. It’s horrible. I cannot solve that problem, I’m not even going to let it occur.So here I was. I’d built a video platform that I didn’t want to advertise because; The alt right might find it and upload videos of them burning other religious folk The actual right wing might find it and upload videos of them burning folk Bad people might use it Cancelled folk will bring it down Navigating the challenges of child care and ensuring COPPA is followed GDPR and everything thereI promptly relegated it as a learning experience and a portfolio piece, which it has done very well! It got me my current job as it was a very interesting project (I tend to not tell them about the latter half of this blog post). Would bring down the mood a bit…ResultThe result was a project that actually worked… Briefly. I build the chat backend in Node.JS then lost the repo due to a self-hosting git issue, so now chat doesn’t work Video uploading worked! It would save the video locally, send the video to S3, a trigger would occur that would then send that video to AWS MediaConvert, that would then send the video to a public bucket where the website would link to it. Streaming simply didn’t work, it would take an army to conquer that and I could hardly afford the cost it took just to maintain the application doing nothing on AWS. I was far to concerned about dangerous parties using it for bad, and being unable to moderate thatSo that is StreamBit.tv, it’s still live now being self hosted, I doubt video uploading works but it serves as a time capsule for what might’ve been possible and hopefully a tale to warn developers against doing the same thing. Although if you are interested in streaming video, re-streaming and getting a job at Twitch, it might be a good idea to fire in and do the same as I did. Albeit, now you’ve been warned." }, { "title": "Self Hosting Your Own Projects", "url": "/posts/self-hosting/", "categories": "development", "tags": "aws, development, php, nginx, webserver", "date": "2022-04-15 20:55:00 +0100", "snippet": "Self HostingSelf hosting has pretty much gone out the door, relegated to being used for top 500 firms, those with in-house sysadmins or a developer testing their own local builds and projects.I was born in 1996, so it was that weird middleground of having my entire childhood nearly tech free. I didn’t grow up with the worry of having a camera pointed in my face or my worst nightmare posted on TikTok. Camcorders were much bigger back then, and they had tapes!So it’s safe to say that the expectation that you’d host your own website, wasn’t ever one that crossed my mind. We had Dial Up, DSL, ADSL, these were never capable of sending a website anywhere. So you relied on data centers and third party to do all that hosting for you!When AWS and Azure came on the scene, it made this a dream. I’m skipping a lot of background obviously but the point exists all the same.Back to BasicsNow a days, you can get an internet connection with 80 down 20 up as standard. This isn’t the truest measure of performance but it’s a hell of a lot better to send data to folk at 20mbit than it ever was at 0.5mbit.I decided to go a bit outlandish for my package, and went with a local firm that supplied gigabit links to resedential properties. I was now dealing with having a connection at 1Gbit, that’s 12 times faster than what I was used to and 99% of the time it was sitting around doing nothing. What could I actually do to utilize the power of this connection. Streaming Netflix is at what, 20mbit. I do all my own local Plex so actually I don’t even stream.We don’t do much around the house, we’re just two people in a house with a couple cats. This connection is overkill. So I figured let’s put it to use!Equipment, Software &amp;amp; Setup iMac Virtual Machine Ubuntu Server EdgeRouter X CloudflareIt’s a real simple setup. I’ve got a virtual machine running on an iMac. That network is bridged with the normal iMac connection. From there I’ve got port forwarding setup on my router to direct any 80 or 443 traffic to that Virtual Machines IP.Now, I can’t just go broadcasting my home IP to the wild, that would be crazy, and sure there’s going to be someone out there that might be able to find it, but to at least protect against the curious, I’ve implemented CloudFlare.Cloudflare will serve up content as a CDN, and since they’re now my nameservers they can protect my IP from any lookups. Win win! And they cost nothing to run as well.So for an old iMac, a router that I already had and a free subscription to CloudFlare. I’ve been able to turn off my two AWS instances and host everything myself. Now of course it doesn’t come with the power of the cloud, with redundency and whatnot. But for projects that are more show pieces than actual businesses, it’s more than enough!ConclusionOne thing might be appearing clear. I used to have a ~£45p/m AWS Bill, very quickly I’ve been able to cut that to nill going down this route. Sure you could argue the cost of power running that iMac. But that serves my plex server anyway, so it would have been on whether I did this or not.I’ll be saving £540 a year. That’s a good saving especially for someone whos projects have always came out their own pocket. It might be a bit more hands on at first, but I’ve been able to leave it alone for a while now and it’s been up running absolutely fine! I did have to take it down one day to fix the ram usage, but other than that, I’ve had non-stop uptime!I’d absolutely put it forward to anyone else in this position. Do you have an internet connection that’s massively over what you need? Do you have spare hardware lying around collecting dust? Might be worth checking into whether it’s worth getting your own things self hosted.Now of course I wouldn’t advocate for this approach these days for any serious implementations or projects. But for your own stuff? Why not! Saves you money and you get a good whack of experience becoming your own mini data center." }, { "title": "Battlefield", "url": "/posts/battlefield/", "categories": "gaming", "tags": "games, battlefield, gaming, battlefield4", "date": "2022-04-15 20:55:00 +0100", "snippet": "Returning to BattlefieldI decided to head back into Battlefield this week just looking for something to play. My experience might surprise you.Back to 2042I got Battlefield 2042 with the order of an M.2 SSD. Figured it was a good deal, until I played the game at launch and figured I’d actually want a refund if I had bought this. The Battlefield 2042 hate train has been boarded many a time, I don’t want to get into everything as to why I don’t like it, but here’s a few… Playing the 128 Player maps just feels way to open and empty I spawned at objectives and would have to run across the open sandy environment, whereby I’d then get randomly shot by a sniper, not fun. Can’t really do an Anti-Tank / Anti-Air build. The gadgets are boring and uninsipiring. Somehow in 2042 we have worse gear than we did in Battlefield 4. Armor seems very OP at the minute. You only get as far as I can tell 3 rockets to destroy stuff with, presuming you hit all 3 shots, even then I’ve still seen armor survive So it’s fair to say, my experience with 2042, was just really boring and not fun. It has that mode where you can play the old battlefield games in the 2042 engine, but no joke it doesn’t feel that great. It’s better to just go back and play Battlefield 4Back to BF4So I did. I went back to play Battlefield 4 this week. It’s been a fantastic time. I’ve been running Anti-Air just taking down helicopters and jets. One thing though that I would say is that any experienced pilot will absolutely do one over on me. You can just fly up into the air, regain your flares/ECM and do another strafing run.It got so bad that I was 1v1ing this guy in a Jet with 6 stingers and he’d flush me of them all. Of course if my team was helping me taking down jets instead of having 1 guy on a 32 player team go after the armor, it might have went a bit better.Either way, even though I was getting, bugger all score and dying it was so fun, the explosions of the jets raining down bombs on our team, me frantically trying to get a stinger off, then saying FUCK IT and going full RPG mode. What a game. I absolutely miss it.It as at this point, where I figured… what about the other Battlefield games, am I missing out on some of the older ones, I never played BF1 or BF5 due to not enjoying the non-modern play style, that and I just don’t think the game is that great in that setting.Back to BF1/BF5I’ll keep this very short. Battlefield 5 is unplayable due to the very unsupported nature of player run servers, so you get cheaters in every lobby with 0 admins there to help. Avoid at all costs.Battlefield 1 was a bit better, but the constant snipers just irrated me, so, ironically I went back to Battlefield 4. At least then I can throw an RPG at them and hope they die.ConclusionIf you’re looking for a shooter, with big armor action and plenty of community support, get yourself into Battlefield 4, it’s cheap these days and I’ve been having a hell of a time. I think if Dice spent the past years pushing BF4 further, they’d have an excellent live service game on their hands rather than giving up and creating a new game every year." }, { "title": "Welcome", "url": "/posts/new-blog/", "categories": "general", "tags": "general, announcement", "date": "2022-04-15 16:27:00 +0100", "snippet": "WelcomeWe’re back using a new blog.
